# Front Tensions MGN9

This project contains a re-design of the front tensioner housings from
Sergei Irbis, and they re-use the stock pulley holder inserts.

The main change is that it uses the M5x45 and M5x25 bolts from the Ender
3 (you need to tap your threads into the extrusion at least 20mm) to make
for a very strong connection.

I have also adjusted the geometry to provide a solid end-stop for my newly
designed Wheel to MGN9 Adapters.

Finally I played with the asthetic to get something that I like better.

## Printing

Print in the same orientation as the stock parts, it should import in the
correct orientation. No support is required as hole recesses have support
built into the model.

## Installation

These should pretty much be a swap from the original part, you re-use the
existing pulley holders so no rebuilding of the bearing stack.

However you will likely need to tap a longer M5 thread into the end of
your extrusions. I have designed for the M5x45 and M5x25 bolts to have
18mm of thread protruding from the mount, so I suggest extending the
thread length to 20mm with a tap.

Use some tape on the tap to make the 20mm position. Make sure to use the
original thread to guide the tap in, as you don't want it cutting a new
thread that is out of alignment.

## CAD

The part is designed using FreeCAD. I can't provide STEP files, sorry, as
FreeCAD can only import STEP files, it cannot export them as far as I know.
