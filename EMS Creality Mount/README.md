# EMS Creality Mount

This is an EMS mount for the Creality control boards as used in the older
Ender-3 and CR-10s.

What is EMS? It is a system for managing the electronics for 3D printers from
FizzyTechs. It consists of a panel with hexagon cutouts, a set of hexagon
shaped plugs that fit into the panel, and a repository of mounts for various
3D printer electrical components. The idea is that if you replace a component,
or need to move one around, you can just print the mount for the new component,
or move the plugs to a different cutout. There are also plugs for zip-ties,
and a set of cable ducts for solving any cable management issue.
