# EMS Creality Mount

This is an EMS mount for the Creality control boards as used in the older
Ender-3 and CR-10s. What is EMS? It is a system for managing the electronics
for 3D printers from FizzyTechs. It consists of a panel with hexagon cutouts,
a set of hexagon shaped plugs that fit into the panel, and a repository of
mounts for various 3D printer electrical components. The idea is that if you
replace a component, or need to move one around, you can just print the mount
for the new component, or move the plugs to a different cutout. There are
also plugs for zip-ties, and a set of cable ducts for solving any cable
management issue.

## Printing

Print with the flat side down, it should import in the correct orientation.
The part has been designed to print with no supports.

## Installation

Install 5 heatset inserts from underneath. Attach the mount to some EMS plugs.
Attach the Creality control board to the mount with some M3x6 or M3x8 bolts.

## CAD

The part is designed using FreeCAD. I can't provide STEP files, sorry, as
FreeCAD can only import STEP files, it cannot export them as far as I know.
