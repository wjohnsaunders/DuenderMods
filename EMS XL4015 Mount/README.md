# EMS XL4015 Mount

This is an EMS mount for the XL4015 voltage regular that is often used to
power Rasoberry Pis from a 3D printers 24V PSU. What is EMS? It is a system
for managing the electronics for 3D printers from FizzyTechs. It consists of
a panel with hexagon cutouts, a set of hexagon shaped plugs that fit into the
panel, and a repository of mounts for various 3D printer electrical components.
The idea is that if you replace a component, or need to move one around, you
can just print the mount for the new component, or move the plugs to a
different cutout. There are also plugs for zip-ties, and a set of cable ducts
for solving any cable management issue.

## Printing

Print with the flat side down, it should import in the correct orientation.
The part has been designed to print with no supports.

## Installation

Install 2 heatset inserts from underneath. Attach mount to an EMS plug or two.
Attach the XL4016 to the mount with some M3x6 or M3x8 bolts.

## CAD

The part is designed using FreeCAD. I can't provide STEP files, sorry, as
FreeCAD can only import STEP files, it cannot export them as far as I know.
